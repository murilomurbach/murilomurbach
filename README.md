<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
<h3 align="center"> Programming student </h3>
<p align="center">
  I've liked programming since I was a kid. I had my first contact with it when I was around 12 years old. At that time, I was curious about how websites and apps worked behind the scenes, so I started researching and watching videos about it. Over time, I began learning on my own, exploring programming languages. Since then, programming has become a passion and something I want to pursue as a career in the future.
